The data links to convey this information must have low latency and high reliability. An effective communications architecture should employ multiple paths for critical ASW data to mitigate against limitations in any one communications system. Many platforms employ one or more radar systems that could be leveraged for this purpose. Utilizing an existing radar for communications could lead to lower lifecycle cost since much of the hardware can be reused or shared. Also, with ship space at a premium, in many cases adding another antenna specifically for a communications system simply may not be feasible. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) effort focuses on the development of a low-cost, real-time network for sharing the ASW Common Tactical Picture (CTP) using a high-power, high-bandwidth radar with excess duty cycle as a broadcast transmitter and a low-cost digital receiver system that can be installed on receiving platforms.

The first effort will be a theoretical task in conjunction with KSU to evaluate important issues related to the abstract nature of the Cummer-Schurig solution, which calls for infinite mass density and stiffness boundary conditions and purely real dynamic quantities (i.e., no losses). The type of resonant dynamical element to be used in the design to create the anisotropic mass densities required will be selected. Two major candidates identified in Phase I are resonant masses requiring voids encapsulated by high rigidity structures (e.g. shells) and a system of shaped inclusions embedded directly in an elastomer matrix. Laboratory experiments guided by co-evolving analytical and numerical models will be performed to demonstrate the required dynamical behavior for each treatment layer, to be followed by fabrication and testing larger cloak layer samples to assure that properties are maintained with scale up.

These redundant and overlapping capabilities ultimately require operators to mentally visualize a hybrid CTP since no single system or display provides the complete, timely, and accurate CTP needed to effectively conduct the ASW mission. Adaptive Methods proposes a Sailor-centric approach for concept definition, ASW systems engineering, and CTP algorithm development and automation. The primary objective of this proposal is to provide the capability for the ASW Commander to develop and share an accurate, real-time Common Tactical Picture (CTP) that conveys his intent with minimal workload on operators across the Force. During the Phase I effort, work was focused on documenting workflows for the CTP, identifying the information needed at the decisions points and how this information will be carried.

The system has adequately demonstrated its ability of safely lifting and omni-directionally maneuvering both standard ISO containers and special flat-racks up to 20-feet long with oversized payloads. The system is designed to operate within the confined deck space aboard both Littoral Combat Ship Variant (LCS1 or LCS2) and other ships. Recognizing the confined space and maneuvering limitations aboard the LCS, particular attention has been paid to operational safety, minimizing the overall system weight and maximizing the flexibility of the CC-LMS for a broad range of mission module operations. The CC-LMS is designed to perform safely carrying a full payload while the ships are operating in elevated sea states. Automated features include the means of rapidly lowering mission modules to the deck when ship motions approach unsafe operating parameters. The system is designed to enable progressive automation of the CC-LMS modes of operation to minimize and simplify personnel interaction and meet emerging future mission requirements. This proposal presents a series of specific tasks that build upon the previous work accomplished on the CC-LMS and focusses upon the areas that require further research and refinement prior to proceeding to the fabrication of a pre-production prototype of the system.

The glue that holds many of these forces together and motivates them to fight is a common belief system, or shared cultural identity. Hence, it is essential to understand cultural identities and cultural issues.  This is difficult because cultural identities are neither monolithic nor static.  An individual person can have multiple cultural identities because he or she belongs to a number of different groups.  Cultural identities are also dynamic.  To address these difficulties, we propose to create the Simulation of Cultural Identities for Prediction of Reactions (SCIPR) system.  SCIPR is a set of analysis methods and a simulation modeling tool that combines a method for determining relevant cultural identities with an agent-based simulation tool to predict responses to events, including U.S. and adversary courses of action (COAs), as well as non-military events, such as civil reconstruction and political events.  SCIPR draws on cultural anthropology to understand how cultural identities are defined and how they may change over time in response to events and actions, and employs agent-based modeling to simulate these dynamics and predict responses to COAs.",Margaret Clancy,Chief Financial Officer,(781) 496-2415,clancy@aptima.com,Justin Boesel,Simulation Analyst,,(202) 842-1548,jboesel@aptima.com,,,,1,,Daniel Serfaty,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,,,"45,273,890","36,500,000",2020,45273890,185,1995,11,11,1,1,1,Tibbetts Award winner

However, current approaches typically remain overly specific to a certain paradigm or collection of tasks. Aptima proposes to fill this gap by developing a flexible measurement system that facilitates rigorous evaluations of multi-tasking performance. Relying on a universal, empirically-driven framework of multi-tasking measurement, Aptima&quot;s approach will utilize: (1) libraries of domain-agnostic and domain-specific performance measures; (2) a measure selection tool that adapts the measure libraries appropriately to a given environment; and (3) measurement software that executes the selected measures. As measures are collected, the proposed system will provide evaluators with the necessary data to identify multi-tasking costs, assess the risks associated with those costs, and devise potential mitigation strategies. In addition, Aptima&quot;s solution will be designed to integrate with a range of test beds, while maintaining flexibility to account for future assessment tools that consume the generated multi-tasking data.",Thomas McKenna,Chief Financial Officer,(781) 496-2443,mckenna@aptima.com,Cullen Jackson,"Div Director, Cognitive S",,(781) 496-2408,cjackson@aptima.com,,,,1,,Daniel Serfaty,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,,,"45,273,890","36,500,000",2020,45273890,185,1995,17,17,1,1,1,Tibbetts Award winner

Box 2607,,Winnetka,CA,91396,,"One of the key limitations in optical band underwater imaging and communications systems is the excessive attenuation and scattering light experiences in traversing the intervening media. Strong attenuation fuels the demand for high transmitter energy and high sensitivity (photon counting) detectors. Strong backscatter can temporarily blind or damage highly sensitive detectors, undermining the systems ability to sense (or communicate) over both short and long distances. In principle, the&quot;backscatter problem&quot;can be mitigated by employing high dynamic range detectors (i.e. a detector that is responsive to both high and low levels of photons). This requirement is often at odds with the sensitivity requirement of detecting a few photons/nanosecond. One potential solution is use a fast optical switch (or attenuator) in front of the detector to gate out the undesired near-field backscatter. Current technology cannot address all of the needs, such as polarization insensitivity, large aperture, and wide acceptance angle. Arete Associates has devised an elegant solution to this problem that promises to meet the demanding requirements in a compact, low-power, open-architecture module.

Specifically, we aim to provide behavior characterization (BC) and anomaly detection (AD) aspects of a geographic regionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aviation traffic in a human-understandable format. This Human-Interpretable AI Learning System (HAILS) is encapsulated as a software service so that it can easily be integrated with multiple systems.

The findings of our Phase I research indicate that the use of AI/ML technologies to determine the BC and AD of area aircraft operations using publically available trajectory data is feasible and very promising for enhancing NAVSEA operatorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ situational awareness in a given geographic region. We successfully demonstrated three key technical aspects: (1) we synthesized and curated aircraft trajectories from ADS-B data so that they are analysis-ready and can be fed into AI/ML algorithms for BC and AD;Ã‚Â  (2) we applied AI/ML algorithms in the form of the Multiple Kernel Anomaly Detector (MKAD), originally developed by NASA, to a subset (i.e., approximately 42,500 arrival flights to San Jose International Airport) for training and anomaly detection; and (3) we increased the geographic scope of the trajectory data for AI/ML input to beyond the San Francisco Bay Area by the fusing of multiple sensory inputs. In Phase II, we develop HAILS leveraging our work and findings from Phase I (described above) and further test it on additional traffic scenarios. To accomplish this, we address three primary objectives in Phase II: (1) Extend prototype BC & AD components to additional traffic scenarios and volume. This objective involves processing additional data in terms of historical timeframe and geographic scope for input to the HAILS learning process; (2) Increase the number of features considered by the AI approach when performing BC & AD. In the AI/ML context, these features are an attribute or property of the system being studied (in this case, the air traffic in a region) on which analysis or prediction is to be done. By increasing the number of features, the number of ways that HAILS can characterize behavior and determine anomalies is increased; and (3) Increase the explainability of the system BC & AD output.Ã‚Â  This objective addresses the key challenge with AI/ML systems in that often users fail to accept the results of AI/ML models because there is no way to explain the reason for the model output in a human-understandable form.",Joe Isaacs,,(408) 736-2822,jai@atac.com,John Schade,,,(408) 736-2822,jes@atac.com,,,,0,,Scott Simcox,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,,,"23,422,141","23,422,000",2020,23422141,616,1979,41,41,,0,0,

This payload will be based on a scalable and modular design that can be extended in frequency, number of channels, and signal processing capabilities for larger platforms.  The SIGINT payload will support a rich set of mission plans, allowing the operator to specify bands of interest, revisit rates, signals of interest, and signals not of interest.  The demonstrations will test the ability of the payload to detect, characterize, and associate signal intercepts as well as geolocate emitters.  Demonstrations will be staged, beginning with a laboratory demo, advancing to a ground-based demo, then an airborne demo in a large aircraft, and finally a demonstration with one or more simultaneous SUAVs.

However, there is a substantial gap between the researchand application of these methods.  One reason is that most of the designs are not practical for use in existing aircraft because they require a complete redesign of the software (control system) and, in some cases, additional hardware (sensors, flightcomputers, etc.).    The proposed work addresses many of the challenges associated with upgrading a production flight control system to improve capabilities of current Navy fleet aircraft.  Reconfiguration is accomplished by computing increments to thepilot's commands that remove unwanted motions during maneuvering with control surface failures, battle damage, and mechanical, electrical, or hydraulic problems.  This add-on (retrofit) control system is unobtrusive - i.e., it only generates nonzeroreconfiguration commands when the aircraft is responding unexpectedly.  Another key advantage of the approach is that the command limiting, structural filters, and safety logic of the production control system remain in effect.  This lessens certificationrequirements compared to other reconfigurable control methods.  Phase II will advance the technology through algorithm and software development, hardware implementation, and F/A-18 flight testing.","B.Eugene Parker, Jr.",,(804) 973-1215,,David Ward,,,(804) 973-1215,,,,,1,,Roger Barron,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,,,"5,186,144",,,5186144,43,1983,18,18,1,1,1,Roger Barron also founded Adaptronics

UBDM is a software/firmware solution that takes baseband IQ (which is typically an identifiable, analyzable, and potentially exploitable constellation pattern) and converts it into a Gaussian distribution of points.

These satellites will include, eventually, proliferated Low Earth Orbit (PLEO) systems, such as SpaceX Starlink and Amazon Kuiper, Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) systems, such as SES O3b Classic and SES mPOWER, Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) systems, such as Space Norway HEOsat, and inclined Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) systems, such as Inmarsat I5 military-Ka band satellites. STtNG is expected to operate on any U.S. Navy surface ships, can be cross-decked from one surface ship to another and made operational within days. STtNG may also operate at Navy shore facilities. Future versions of STtNG are expected to be used in submarines and on aircraft. STtNG must be capable of both acquiring and maintaining satellite communications links from the decks of Navy surface ships while those ships are in high sea states that produce significant pitching, rolling, and yawing motions of the ship while underway. Based on combining the simultaneous future three-link capability of the Isotropic Ka-band terminal with a single Starlink Ku-band terminal and an Iridium link, one STtNG terminal will be capable of maintaining five simultaneous satellite communications links. The carry-on capability of the STtNG dictates that each STtNG subsystem be of a size and weight that it can be moved by two individuals without the need for motorized or special equipment to transport the terminal subsystems. The design and construction of the STtNG terminal will incorporate graceful degradation as components fail. The Isotropic Systems terminal provides unmatched flexibility for connectivity and communications within the Ka commercial and mil-Ka bands. The Isotropic terminal is a low-profile electrically-steered antenna that leverages a novel RF Lens Array technology for reducing power consumption and enabling multiple simultaneous links to multiple satellites in any orbit. Crucially, enabling a second link does not reduce the performance of the first link, and both links support the same full performance when operated in either single- or dual-link modes. The Isotropic terminal is an integrated SATCOM terminal, with embedded frequency conversion, amplification, power supply, and antenna control unit, and also allows for modems to be field-installed within the terminal to reduce the challenge of wiring and integration during installation and commissioning.",Stacey McCarthy,,(269) 271-6966,mccarthy@bascomhunter.com,Samuel Subbarao,,,(225) 283-2158,subbarao@bascomhunter.com,,,,0,,Andrew McCandless,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,,,"6,309,050",,,6309050,23,2010,12,12,1,1,1,Tibbetts Award winner; Princeton spin-off; received USAF Phase III award

Our vision is centered on creating a solution along three vectors: - Supporting the tag-out process of maintenance, making it more efficient and cost effective - Capturing, sharing and analyzing work performance data in order to inform the ESDS model - Utilizing the tag-out process as a proxy for understanding the usefulness of the capture of human performance data",Mike MacEwen,Founder&President,(617) 453-5501,mike.macewen@beaconinteractive.com,ML Mackey,Founder&CEO,,(617) 453-5503,ml.mackey@beaconinteractive.com,Stub,,,0,,ML Mackey,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,"5,923,381",,,5923381,,1994,18,18,,0,0,

We see the transition of technology in a three-phased process: Macro, Evaluative and Micro.  The Macro phase is determining the overall need, the Evaluative phase is the analysis of technology vis-ÃƒÂ -vis need and the micro phase is the collection of information necessary for decision-making.

This device is left on site until revisited at some later time by another system able to localize it.  Current marker/pinger technology typically transmits energy in a narrow spectral band.  The implications of such a transmission are:  the signals are easily detectable by undesirable observers; two or more markers transmitting simultaneously will cause confusion in detection and bearing estimation.  Furthermore, current marker/pinger technology would be wasteful of energy in broadband signaling, resulting in unnecessarily reduced operational life.  Our Phase One efforts concentrated on the development of a robust, broadband signaling scheme based upon our acoustic communications (acomms) technology, and on the development of a new technology for efficient conversion of electrical power to broadband acoustic power.  These combined developments will permit the construction of a smart marker with the following capabilities:    1. We propose to operate the marker in a 10 kHz band, with the low end of the band suitable for the ONR-designated band C.  However, the center frequency could be higher and the band much wider to suit application.   2. Among other configurations, the markers will be configured to operate in conjunction with both the existing Benthos ATM 885 and the WHOI Micromodem operating in band C.  3. We will provide a minimum1 km range for a battery-powered marker.  4. We plan to provide as many as three operating modes for battery-powered units.  Modes will include a fully ""awake"" mode, a ""drowsy"" mode, and a hibernation mode.  Continuous ""awake"" operation will result in a battery life of about 22 days.   5. Our preferred mode of operation is to command an individual marker to respond with a coded, ""covert"" frequency hopping (FH) sequence.  Other signaling modes are possible.   6.

Reynolds number effects, which are relatively limited for thin airfoil fighter configurations, are much more pronounced for the thick airfoil transport configurations, and complicate the utilization of static and dynamic data in this region.

PANORAMA learns normalcy patterns, taking into account: (1) that shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past behavior, (2) the past behavior of similar ships, (3) normalcy patterns in the shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s current location, and (4) normalcy pattern in the shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s current environmental conditions (e.g., weather). PANORAMA then assesses the likelihood that each subsequent movement is consistent with these patterns, generating alerts for the most significant anomalies. By subsuming context and local normalcy patterns into the ML model, we learn from data more efficiently and reduce the false alarm rate. In Phase I, we showed that this framework can also address related Navy problems, such as learning patterns of life, monitoring shipping lanes and harbors, and responding rapidly to changes in patterns. In Phase II, we will build PANORAMA into a full-scale Navy system that handles a huge data volume/velocity, ingests data from other Navy sources, and makes additional important functionality Ã¢â‚¬â€ such as event recognition and behavior-based ID Ã¢â‚¬â€ available to the Navy.

For this Phase 2 project, BRO proposes to design, build, demonstrate performance and conduct several environmental test of our deck floodlight system.  As part of our design process, we plan to use as many off-the-shelf solutions as possible in order to add capability and reduce cost where the performance of the system is not compromised.

These users require real-time alerting systems that provide tripwires that identify operator behaviors, emergent conditions, or reduction in available resources that influence the effectiveness of operations. Having successfully demonstrated the feasibility under a Phase I SBIR effort, Charles River Analytics is pleased to propose a Phase II effort to develop and evaluate a Distributed Analysis Tool for Enterprise Monitoring (DATEM). DATEM is a distributed monitoring and alerting system that sets tripwires to detect deviations in operator and system behaviors that are important to mission success. DATEM uses non-invasive monitoring tools to gather, extract, aggregate, summarize, and reason about this system data in the context of the current mission. DATEM uses probabilistic models to deal with uncertain, missing, and erroneous data in tripwires that alert operators, administrator, managers, and commanders of system conditions that may threaten mission readiness.",Mark Felix,,(617) 491-3474,mfelix@cra.com,Joe Gorman,Principal Software Engine,,(617) 491-3474,jgorman@cra.com,,,,1,,Karen Harper,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,,,"46,418,016",,,46418016,157,1983,32,32,1,1,1,

Social science research aims to achieve this understanding by developing theories and models of human behavior and interaction. However, there is currently a chasm between the research and operational communities, making it difficult to apply research findings in mission environments. Augmenting this work with tools that provide insights into the validity of social science conclusions can facilitate more informed application of these findings in operational settings and provide methodological guidance to help the research community achieve more robust outcomes. To address these challenges, we completed a Phase I effort where we successfully designed and demonstrated a Platform for Research Optimization and Creation of Experiments in Social Science (PROCESS).

Taylor Avenue,,Louisville,CO,80027,,"Ship defense requires 100 kW-1MW near diffraction-limited lasers with optimal wavelength and temporal format.  Laser efficiency, beam quality, atmospheric transmission, thermal-blooming, and target interactions must be taken into account.  Navy efforts to date have focused principally on the free electron laser (FEL) to fulfill this need due to the wide wavelength tuning range and projected high electrical-to-optical efficiency.  FEL's will likely be implemented on next-generation electric ships, but for existing ships and for UAV's, the compact size of a solid-state laser makes it a very attractive option.  1 micron wavelength solid-state lasers are currently being pursued in many directed energy applications due to the maturity of this technology at high power.  CW and high peak power solid-state lasers are each likely to be optimal for different targets and different thermomechanical interactions.  With current solid-state laser technology, 1-5 kW average output power can be achieved in pulsed or CW mode at 1 micron, but typically with modest efficiency and >2x diffraction limited beam quality from a bulky system.  CTI proposes a breakthrough laser architecture (validated in proof-of-concept demonstrations) to enable development of compact, power-scalable MOPA systems.  The architecture implements a proprietary technology for achieving higher efficiencies than rod or slab architectures, with near diffraction-limited beam quality and minimal thermo-optic aberrations.

Threaded components and fasteners manufactured from these alloys require sacrificial protective coatings due to the corrosive environment.  Cadmium has traditionally been the preferred coating for such threaded components and fasteners due to its many desirable functional qualities.  In addition to corrosion protection, cadmium also provides excellent lubricity characteristics; however, cadmium is a toxic metal and known carcinogen that poses environmental and occupational safety and health risks throughout the life cycle of the plated parts.  ES3 successfully completed the Phase I effort meeting its primary goal of demonstrating that IZ-C17+ with trivalent conversion coating IZ-264 performs as well as Low Hydrogen Embrittlement (LHE) Cad plate on threads for upfront screening tests.  Phase II testing validates the Zn-Ni IZ-C17+ with IZ-264 post treatment process in comparison to LHE cad utilizing industry accepted requirements for threaded fasteners / components for process installation, corrosion, thickness, fatigue, adhesion, hydrogen embrittlement and resistance to paint strippers and fluids  The Phase II.5 transition plan will focus on implementing a full scale alkaline Zn-Ni (IZ-C17+) process barrel and rack plating line for usage at WR-ALC, conducting field evaluations and updating the technical data to authorize the use of alkaline Zn-Ni on LSS and HSS threaded fasteners and components for aircraft structural, propeller, and landing gear components..    BENEFIT:  Research conducted to evaluate the alkaline zinc-nickel as a cadmium alternate focuses on military applications at USAF&quot;s aircraft component and propeller maintenance repair facility at Robins AFB, Georgia; however, benefits will be similar for all commercial &amp; military aircraft, engine and landing gear usages where cadmium electroplating is applied.  The following list benefits ES3 expects from the alkaline zinc-nickel process for electroplating of threaded fasteners and components based on both industry and in-house research:   Drop in replacement for all cad plated, threaded components and fasteners on low and high strength steel components.   Eliminate health exposure concerns of cad plating (including brush cad) and meet OSHA emission regulations.   Replace all IVD aluminum process, gaining the following benefits:  o Ability to plate Internal Diameters (ID)  o Lower processing costs  o Unlimited process size constraints (tank size is only limiting factor).  IVD chambers are size limited.   o Eliminate Hydrogen Re-Embrittlement risks after exposure to aqueous cleaners.  o Increased lubricity factors over IVD.

The magnetron sputtering System (MSS) process has the potential of restoring outer cylinders IDs dimensions. This technology is similar to ion vapor deposition (IVD) aluminum, and meets the same specification MIL-DTL-83488.   ES3&quot;s RODS Phase I testing results were very positive and indicated that 6061 aluminum alloy MSS coatings have a great potential for repairing the IDs of aluminum outer cylinders. The results for the 7075 aluminum MSS coatings were: 1) Similar hardness properties as the substrate alloy material. 2) Withstood high bending loads without spalling off.  3) Wear characteristics increased by almost 200% on the sputtered surface vs. the bare surface of the 7075 coupons.

Phase II feasibility testing shall be conducted on coupons consisting of 7000 series aluminum alloy to provide acceptable model of actual landing gear components in operations. Also, Field Service Evaluation of several landing gear outer cylinders will be conducted to certify the MSS process.  After MSS process passes the testing and    FSE a process specification will be developed for MSS.    BENEFIT:  Research conducted to develop magnetron sputtering (PVD) systems, which can restore IDs of worn or damaged land gear aluminum outer cylinders, focuses on military applications; however, benefits will be similar for all commercial &amp; military landing gear that need IDs restored to original dimensions.    ES3 expects the following benefits from magnetron sputtering systems restoring the Inner Dimension of landing gear outer cylinders based on both industry and in-house research:     Outer cylinders with worn or damage IDs can be restored to serviceable condition   Increased supportability of aluminum landing gear parts for USAF and commercial industry   Reduction in ownership cost for the USAF and commercial industry   Magnetron sputtering could be used to repair other aircraft parts",Doug Wiser,COO,(801) 928-2769,doug.wiser@es3inc.com,Jay Randolph,"Director, SE operations",,(478) 957-1278,jay.randolph@es3inc.com,Stub,,,0,,Teri Sgammato,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,,,"22,784,765","1,169,000",2001,22784765,135,2000,13,13,1,1,1,

Loop Drive,,Ames,IA,50010,,"There are several key components to making efficient high performance TERFENOL-D actuators and sonar projectors. TERFENOL-D being a magnetically driven material requires magnetic materials and circuit design considerations.One of the principle considerations in a TERFENOL-D actuator is the lamination of the drive rod assembly to minimize eddy current generation. It has not been well investigated the performance trade-off between lamination thickness and performance of thetransducer. This study will develop a relationship between lamination thickness and predicted transducer performance. These models will be used to calculate performance trade off studies and cost impacts.Alternative production methods and materials used for the lamination of TERFENOL-D rod assemblies will be investigated to find lamination technologies to increase the electrical isolation between TERFENOL-D laminae. The appropriate material will alsoenhance production processes to further reduce the cost of producing TERFENOL-D drive assemblies.Control of the magnetic flux energy within a magnetostrictive transducer is a critical component in the design of a magnetostrictive actuator. Advanced soft magnetic materials will be evaluated for magnetic material properties and near net shape formingtechniques. These materials can become a notable cost component in the production of a TERFENOL-D actuator. Methods to reduce costs will be evaluated.New TERFENOL-D composite materials currently under development in other programs will be evaluated for applicability to naval sonar and other applications. Composite TERFENOL-D has the potential to produce near net shape TERFENOL-D drivers that can operateat frequencies above 100kHz. These composite TERFENOL-D drivers also have the potential to produce very inexpensive driver assemblies.BENEFITS: The final goal is to decrease the cost of TERFENOL-D transducers by a justifiable reduction in theinter-laminate resistance specifications, use of new TERFENOL-D materials, improved bonding and manufacturing techniques used in production of both TERFENOL-D and soft magnetics and additional research into new and improved Giant MagnetostrictiveTransduction Designs.","Flowers, Bill",V.P.

In addition, the need to model a real world operational environment will also require a flexible and adaptable model building capability. This effort will significantly enhance LCOM ATK front-end capabilities in data preparation to ensure that JSF is able to meet the schedule and technical challenges to develop model inputs resulting in significant savings to the JSF program. FTI will incorporate diverse data sources into the front-end capability that exists only as a prototype and is being extended in this effort. These diverse data sources include Logistics Support Analysis (LSA) data from Lockheed Martins (LM) Aeros ATLAS database, as well as Joint Reliability Maintainability Evaluation Team (JRMET) Failure Reporting And Corrective Action Software (FRACAS) data. In this effort, FTI will also extend the automation of the import of JSF data into LCOM ATK models, as well enhance the capability to perform advanced analyses. This effort will demonstrate a computer program able to perform RAMS simulations representative of those performed under normal use conditions.BENEFIT:The technology will be included as an enhancement to LCOM ATK, and specifically a data import application that is part of the LCOM ATK suite, which was developed in an initial effort and will be extended during this Phase II CRP effort. The technology is expected to significantly improve performance as a result of this CRP effort in the preparation and analysis of LCOM ATK inputs, which is the leading time constraint in developing and performing LCOM analyses. Also, the enhanced input capabilities resulting from this CRP effort will provide a new, fully robust capability for automated generation of LCOM ATK inputs, which has only existed in part prior to this effort. Another benefit of improved LCOM analyses are greater reliability and cost savings for the Joint Strike Fighter system based on better, more informed decisions throughout the life cycle.

This effort will focus on maturing the component technologies involved with radome material selection, Ku-band RF feed and feed mount design, and development of mechanical/electrical interfaces for pointing and steering, and to transition all of the components into a prototype 4-m aperture SATCOM antenna.  BENEFIT:  The US military has a stated requirement to pass high bandwidth communications to and from theater and regional hubs.  The development of a 4-meter class inflatable SATCOM antenna will meet that need while reducing transport weight and cube by greater than 20:1 over current hard-dish hub SATCOM antennas.

This concept takes advantage of the work already accomplished by NAVSEA with the permanent composite patch solution and simplifies the products and surface preparation. A thixotropic epoxy adhesive eliminates the use of liquids that can spill and eliminates the ability need to mix and measure. Cartridges that dispense a pre-measured amount of resin hardener through a static mixer will enable easy use aboard ship. The epoxy adhesive will be shear thinning which allows a gel like adhesive to easily saturate a lightweight reinforcing fabric. Testing to evaluate the performance of this repair method will include tensile adhesion, lap shear, and laminate strength testing to determine the ability to stop crack propagation.

Impact Technologies will work with Beacon Interactive Systems in a collaborative environment and demonstrate both companiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ independent tools with mutual interaction in the same system. The maintenance management optimization software will utilize various levels of engineering analysis based on shipboard system health indices/status that are coupled with comprehensive economic models that will form the basis of the automated maintenance optimization process.  With the emphasis on increasing ship system readiness and reducing the total ownership cost for the future DD(X) platform, automated maintenance scheduling and resource optimization certainly are major critical links to driving these goals. As the ultimate goal is defined as maximizing readiness and/or minimizing cost, risk can be defined as either total ownership cost or expected down time. The benefits of performing maintenance tasks have been quantified in risk. The Phase I program successfully demonstrated the feasibility of shore based and shipboard maintenance scheduling by utilizing risk minimization with mixed integer linear programming. Based on the Phase I results, the Phase II program will focus on specific applications on DD(X) such as the Main Turbine System (MTS), which Impact is currently working on maintenance reasoning software for Rolls Royce Naval Marine and Northrop Grumman.",Mark Redding,President,(585) 424-1990,mark.redding@impact-tek.com,G.

Within this paradigmshift approach, embedded diagnostics improvements are being pursued through the evaluation of improved sensed features, artificial intelligence methods, and more detailed consideration of available situational data from bus monitors and environmentalsensors. In addition, an ambiguity group analysis that employs data fusion is being developed to assist the at-wing, automated test equipment, to rank probable causes. The information continuity through the maintenance and logistics systems is best enabledwith a suitable open architecture protocol, such as those based upon CORBA or XML implementations of OSA-CBM. The approach allows the diagnostics results, symptoms evaluated, and operational/environmental conditions to be more easily captured in a databasethat allows for further data mining, clustering, case-based reasoning, and other knowledge discovery methods. The proposed work addresses the development of embedded diagnostic/prognostic avionics health management technologies that will provide dramaticimprovement to the current state of avionics diagnostics and repair. This will, in turn, improve overall mission readiness by decreasing the downtime for repair and total number of repair instances. The development and integration of embedded diagnosticsand prognostics within avionics system and support test equipment will provide many benefits including: improved safety associated with system operations; reduced life cycle or total ownership costs; optimized maintenance intervals and prioritized taskperformance; and increased combat readiness/availability of military systems. We also anticipate a significant reduction in CND, RTOK, and NFF with the diagnostics/prognostics software modules and associated open architecture protocols generated under thisprogram. In addition, the work will contain many generic elements that can be transitioned to a broad range of other applications. The embedded diagnostics approaches, techniques, and specific algorithms could also be implemented in a wide range ofmilitary as well as commercial applications in the civilian aviation community (passenger aircraft, cargo transports, business jets, private aircraft, etc.).

Present inspection methods employ an ultrasonic testing transducer that is slowly rotated around a fastener to develop a map of the full 360 degree region.  Since a focused beam transducer is used, only a single pencil-point region is checked at a time, so the process takes minutes per fastener.  These devices also require extensive training. The combination of long inspection times and high operator skill requirements limits the overall probability of detection of any cracks or flaws. Eddy current systems are effective but only for near surface anomalies.    In contrast, the ultrasound camera shows deeper cracks than what eddy currents can generate.

Advanced radar systems on large remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs) include Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Ground Moving Target Indicators (GMTI).  The ability to identify and track vehicles and dismounts has become a key focus.  Small (< 10 lb) radars with SAR imaging capabilities exist for RPAs, but GMTI capabilities are not yet available on Tier I/II programs of record.  Incorporating dismount detection and tracking capabilities into small RPAs will be a significant force multiplier and improve the tactical commanders Battlefield Awareness and is the focus of this Advanced Radar Concepts for Small RPAs program.    The Advanced Radar Concepts for Small RPAs Phase I program clearly demonstrates the feasibility of innovative approaches needed to bridge the gap between advanced weapon system radars and small Size Weight & Power (SWaP) radar systems that can operate on Tier I/II programs of record RPAs.  The objective of Phase II is to mature small SWaP GMTI technology and demonstrate real-time GMTI radar capabilities within the stringent SWaP constraints of these Teir I/II RPAs.    BENEFIT:  GMTI and dismount detection radar is a force multiplier that will help the tactical commander to dispel the fog of war and the uncertainty of ever changing battlefield conditions.  Pushing this important and proven technology down to the smallest RPAs will provide accurate and timely situational awareness information to commanders of forward operational bases and the small tactical units critical for the protection of personnel and concentration of force.    Moreover, agencies responsible for border patrol, law enforcement, and search and rescue operations will benefit from this technology.  GMTI will improve their ability to efficiently search and patrol large areas.

Through the use of native IP, Innoflight will introduce seamless networked communications through space vehicle links, ground stations, the mission operations center and end users.  Our proposed solution includes a powerful link encoder, IP/HDLC, Type 1 HAIPE encryption, Gbps speeds and a routing function Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all implemented on a single space vehicle subsystem appliance.   This effort will transform multiple spacecraft into networked vehicles which have high performance, secure, networkable communications to each other and through to the ground segment user.   Our efforts will advance the transformation of tactical spacecraft by supporting net-centric operations and rapid integration of PnP spacecraft consistent with the satellite data model approach.  It will also unleash the capability to host and serve many applications on one vehicle consistent with modern systems.  Last, it will enable mission designers to operate over any IP network (Internet, SIPRNet, Classified WANs) as a black core without the need for specialized dedicated, bandwidth sensitive transport infrastructure.  BENEFIT:  Anticipated benefits of the SBIR Phase II include: 1) Seamless space networked communications (end-to-end) with HAIPE security, 2) Lower cost mission operations, ground stations and communications infrastructure, 3) Rapid spacecraft development and integration, 4) DoD Type 1 plug-n-play enabled space and ground appliances for operations over a black core 4) Multi-protocol spacecraft applications, and 5) The use of established IP networks for distributed net-centric operations. The customers for this technology include every branch of the military (and their supporting research and development agencies and institutions) since each one provides systems or relies on systems that communicate from space.  To increase the market size, our technology extends very well to UAV systems as they require high reliability, highly autonomous communication links along with network centric operations within the theater and from space.  A UAV can simply be enabled as a node in a secure network (similar to the remote tracking station) and be equipped with the communications appliance to receive critical data or information from a satellite above.   The fact that our proposed technology is founded on open standards and plug-n-play will open our commercialization capabilities significantly as numerous DoD agencies and NASA ARC are looking to AFRLÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s SPA efforts to drive down the cost and increase the responsiveness of space missions.  Our primary target is the DoD small satellite (most notably, CubeSats) and Operationally Responsive Space (e.g., TACSAT) market which includes research, development and demonstration programs from DARPA, MDA, AFRL, SMC, and NRO.  CubeSats have a lot to gain from this technology due to the fact that a cluster, swarm or tight formation of CubeSats is basically mandatory in order to qualify as a significant DoD mission.  It is expected that these CubeSats form a network to enable sensor collaboration, autonomous reconfiguration, shared computing and a host of other capabilities enabled in a network centric architecture.  Similarly, DARPA''s F6 program will gain from this technology.  The emergence of these missions and ORSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s staunch support of open standards and plug-n-play indicates the awareness that National Security objectives can be met through low-earth orbiting small spacecraft and more responsive missions.   NASA''s Constellation Program, is another prominent customer for this technology especially the ability to establish robust long distance networking capabilities for lunar systems including the implementation of IPsec Ã¢â‚¬â€œ potentially with the need for NSA certified HAIPE solutions. Last, but certainly not least when it comes to commercialization potential, future net-centric space secure communications demonstrate a significant and emerging demand for a Type 1 IP-based space solution.

FLOW evaluates performance using the analystsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ actions in Scraawl and their responses to prompts in the instructional lessons. As lessons advance, instructional scaffolding is gradually removed so that analysts begin performing more independently. Flow also supports analysts during operational analyses. FLOW will capture workflow traces and allow analysts to document their reasoning at critical decision points. The workflow traces will serve as analytic artifacts (for report deliverables) and allow analysts to compare their workflows to those of experts as a way to get feedback and continue improving their analytic skills.

Although ESGN is very reliable and very precise, its Life Cycle Cost (LCC) is very high. The interferometric fiber optic gyroscope (IFOG) will significantly lower the LCC of submarinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ navigation systems. One weak point in the current IFOG based navigation system the slip rings based data link. The slip ring suffers some rare intermittent faults, which are due to moisture trapped inside the slip ring. These glitches may cause big navigation errors in rate gyros like IFOG. Our solution to minimize these glitches caused by the slip rings is to replace the slip rings by an extremely reliable wireless data link. The design of this wireless data link for FOGN is difficult because FOGN uses a spherical gimbal set (SGS) and the only openings that RF signals can propagate through layers of gimbals are small pin holes. During Phase II of this project, we will design a wireless data link based on Multi-band Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) radio, and integrate it with BoeingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Micro-Thermal Control SGS to demonstrate that the proposed wireless data link is more reliable than slip rings.",Mark James,Director of Contracts and,(301) 294-5221,mjames@i-a-i.com,Chujen Lin,"Vice President, Research",,(301) 294-5236,chujen@i-a-i.com,,,,0,,Leonard Haynes,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,"62,771,542","62,770,000",2020,62771542,230,1987,22,22,,0,1,Acquired by BlueHalo through an LBO in 2021: https://bluehalo.com/press_release/bluehalo-bolsters-technical-capabilities-and-intellectual-property-with-the-acquisition-of-intelligent-automation-inc/

We will also explore related applications for MBK technology of direct benefit to Navy/Marine Corps amphibious operations, including an extended MBK for use as a floating causewayÃ¢â‚¬â€for direct ship-to-shore vehicle offload in austere ports, and as a means to traverse rivers and marshy areasÃ¢â‚¬â€and for improving waterborne performance of existing amphibious vehicles by increasing reserve buoyancy and reducing resistance.",Martin Kao,,(808) 531-7001,mkao@navatekltd.com,James Stusse James Stusse,Research Engineer,,(401) 932-6961,jstusse@navatekltd.com,,,,0,,Steven Loui,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,,1,"32,277,566",,,32277566,84,1979,38,38,1,1,0,Acquired by Martin Kao in 2020; also goes by PacMar Technologies or NAVATEK; https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/07/the-fight-to-save-a-top-hawaii-defense-contractor-as-federal-fraud-charges-swirl/

However the severe aerodynamic heating conditions will expose the structure to short term temperatures and stresses that are beyond those typically seen by these materials.  Nevertheless because the airframes are required to survive these conditions for very short times, it may be possible to employ PMCs as primary structural materials.  Designs using these materials are presently limited by the lack of a consistent database that reflects the property degradation caused by severe short term thermal exposure.  Materials Research & Design, Inc. (MR&D) proposes to continue the Phase I effort to develop a design method and supporting database that will enable the use of PMCs in short term, high temperature applications.  The overall goal of the Phase II program is to demonstrate the use of PMCs as a missile structure that is exposed to extreme, short term thermal loads.  The structure may include the Phase I ra-dome, or the fuselage, fairings, control surfaces, strakes, or fins.  Specific objectives of the Phase II effort are separated into Part A and Part B. The goal of Part A will be to compare a degraded PMC design to a baseline design in terms of weight, cost, and performance to show that the use of PMCs offers real system benefits.  The goal of Part B will be to fabricate a PMC subcomponent suitable for government sponsored testing in a high temperature wind tunnel.  The Phase II program will include tasks that address design and analysis, material fabrication, assessment of high heating rate behavior, creation of a thermostructural database, and manufacture of a representative missile subcomponent.  Another important outcome of the project will be a micromechanical model for use by the Navy and its contractors to design degrading PMCs with other fiber architectures, heating rates, etc.   The program will be performed by a team of MR&D, Raytheon Missile Systems, Physical Sciences, Inc.

Raytheon will guide the study, provide system information, and fabricate a selected high temperature PMC materials and subcomponents.  PSI will simulate aerodynamic heat loads using the Laser Hardened Materials Evaluation Laboratory (LHMEL) at Wright-Patterson and define effective properties under high heating rates    SoRI will generate the database by characterizing the material under conditions of short term, high temperature thermostructural loads.

Swedesford Rd,,Wayne,PA,19087,,"The performance of the JSF can be improved by reducing the weight of the propulsion system.  The JSF is powered by either Pratt & WhitneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (P&W) F135 engine or General ElectricÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s F136 engine.  Both engines use a common exhaust system produced by P&W.  One attractive approach to reducing the weight of the JSF propulsion system is to replace high density metal nozzle compo-nents with CMCs. In fact, CMCs have shown promise as flaps and seals on F110 turbojets that are presently undergoing flight testing at Hill AFB.  Very promising results have been exhibited by S200 CMC (Nicalon/SiNC) flaps and seals.  Specifically several S200 5Ã¢â‚¬Â x 21Ã¢â‚¬Â x 0.070Ã¢â‚¬Â 0/90 laminates have survived hundreds of hours of flight testing, including hundreds of afterburner lights.  Not only do the CMCs weigh less than the existing metal components but they also eliminate the cracking and warping that the metal parts exhibit due to the high thermal gradients and high acous-tic loads.  However, after several hundred hours of exposure the CMC flaps begin to delaminate and lose surface plies.  Test experi-ence coupled with stress analysis indicates that if the material maintained its original properties the flaps would not suffer damage.  However, the flight tests show that over time the CMC properties degrade, leading to delamination and ply loss.  Thus in order to employ CMCs in JSF propulsion components it is nec-essary to understand the material degradation mechanisms and ap-ply that understanding to the design of CMC components.  The degraded properties of the S200 CMCs are controlled by several environmental variables including loads, temperatures, atmosphere, time, and preconditioning.  The loads include static and fatigue events, and mechanical and thermal loads.  The ambi-ent temperature will affect the CMC behavior even if the CMC is undamaged and stress free.  The chemistry of the surrounding at-mosphere may include air and moisture, which will affect the ma-terial behavior.  Furthermore the CMC behavior will depend on exposure time.  Finally the condition of the CMC prior to test-ing will theoretically affect the behavior so the program will address the properties of both virgin and precracked materials.  It may be possible to develop design information on de-graded properties and CMC lifetimes through a purely empirical approach in which materials are exposed to various environments and tested to determine their properties.  The number of mate-rial properties and environmental variables, however, will in-clude several hundred sets of data making a purely empirical ap-proach prohibitively expensive and time consuming.  An alterna-tive approach, proposed here, is to develop a physics-based mi-cromechanical model, grounded by correlation with critical meas-ured properties that can compute degraded properties and life-times.  This material model can be subsequently coupled with fi-nite element models of CMC components to design parts accounting for degraded properties and long term behavior.",Kent Buesking,Director,(610) 964-6130,buesking@m-r-d.com,Guido Teti,Senior Engineer,,(610) 964-9000,guido.teti@m-r-d.com,,,,0,,Brian Sullivan,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,,"4,732,819",,,4732819,,1996,9,9,,0,1,

Inspections are typically carried out via point-by-point measurement techniques that sometimes require erection of significant scaffolding to access the structure and which, by their very design, are susceptible to missing possibly important information if the sampling grid-work is too coarse.  Furthermore, current methods for storing and manipulating inspection data gathered on composite structures are cumbersome and rarely linked to analysis tools needed to quantify the damage severity and assess the impact on overall structural integrity.  The goal of this SBIR program is to develop and demonstrate a structural damage assessment system (SDAS) designed to quickly provide data on the health of a composite structure.  The concept proposed by MSC integrates traditional and emerging wide-area inspection techniques with wireless device(s) that transfers data to specialty analysis software using an 802.15 protocol that processes the information and returns the health assessment.

These units will use onlypresently available, low cost instruments and will provide a highdegree of protection against jamming of the GPS receiver.  Ourpartner in carrying out this program is Synetics, Inc.We are considering the ""Accelerometers Only"" (AO) inertialnavigator concept in the Phase II program.  This navigator doesnot require gyros; it uses only accelerometers which arepresently available as low-cost, gun-hard COTS devices.  Althoughthis program will focus on the AO navigator, much of the resultswill be applicable to a system using a conventional INS as well.Thus a very similar system could be considered for application toERGM or other gliding projectiles.BENEFITS: The proposed R & D effort will result in the flight qualified, low-cost tactical GEU with high anti-jam capability.

Surface search radar systems use a plasma limiter to protect the receiver front end from high power microwave (HPM) reflected from RADARs own transmission and electromagnetic interferences (EMI). In the presence of high-power signal plasma limiter switch to nonconducting mode and reflect the incident high power from the input port. This reflected power is routed to a large absorptive load to prevent re-radiation of this signal again. Plasma limiter is a bulky, costly device with a limited operating life.

Our Phase I SBIR focused on the development of rapid 3D(range, bearing and depth) localization solution against active emissions detected on existing submarine sensors. The results of our Phase I study showed that accurate 3D localization solutions are achievable out to tactically significant ranges againstactive or passive sources in a 360-degree field of view provided that the active emission or passive signal is detected on at least four spatially separated sensors. Our Phase II SBIR focuses on the development and at-sea testing of a real timenon-collinear wavefront curvature ranging system. The real time system will use the SONARTECH/ATLAS Intercept Ranging and Detection System (IDRS) hardware and time difference of arrival (TDOA) estimation techniques as the basis for the SBIR Phase IIprototype system. Additional TDOA processing channels and interfaces will be added to this baseline system to accommodate existing and new sensors on a 688I class submarine. The non-collinear wavefront curvature ranging algorithm developed in Phase I willbe implemented in the IDRS hardware system. Additional displays and controls will be added to accommodate the increased number of processing channels. A graphical target motion analysis (TMA) algorithm will also be implemented to determine the velocity ofthe source of the active emissions. Finally, a Signal Feature Extractor (SFE) will be developed and implemented to determine the salient features of complex active emissions. The Phase II Option focuses on the estimation of the TDOAs against these complexactive emissions. In the option, the SFE will be implemented and integrated with match filter and replica correlators to determine the TDOAs associated with the complex active emissions. BENEFITS: MIKEL, INC is in a unique position to develop an improvedactive intercept system with the potential to form the basis of an improved situational awareness and collision avoidance capability. This is because MIKEL, INC has expertise in time delay estimation, non-collinear wavefront curvature ranging techniquesand in the development of target motion analysis  (TMA) algorithms and has a close professional relationship with SONARTECH/ATLAS, an expert in the development of real time TDOA estimation and wavefront curvature ranging systems (PIPRS and IDRS). Webelieve that a military commercialization opportunity may be available based on the technology developed and implemented under this SBIR. This opportunity would involve the transition of this technology to improved active intercept systems being consideredfor all classes of U.S. submarines, The initial customers would be PMS 415, PMS 425 and PMS 450. In addition, the results of this SBIR have applicability to commercial systems involving the detection and tracking of marine mammals, ocean exploration andharbor defense for Homeland Security.

To address space operations capability gaps, Modus Operandi&quot;s objective is the development of BackSweep, an innovative, net-centric architecture and prototype tool for automating the retrieval of relevant contextual information related to anomalous space-related events, helping warfighters understand the potential causes and impacts of these events.  BackSweep will use semantic technologies and probabilistic models to formally represent and reason over the environmental, mission and system contexts of space assets.

Also during transient operation energy is lost in deceleration and braking to pumping friction and brake heat. Providing a means of dynamically harvesting energy of the driveline and turbocharger could allow this energy to be reused. The engine turbocharger coupled to an electric motor-generator could harvest energy during deceleration which could be re-introduced to minimize turbo-lag on acceleration, providing more boost pressure with lower turbine backpressure resulting in higher engine efficiency.

Optical Physics Company is proposing to develop a novel passive optical approach to build a modern day celestial navigation system (CNS) composed of (1) a dual-axis star tracker module and (2) a horizon tracker. The concept is based on a straightforward algorithm which locks celestial coordinates to an Earth-centric baseline. The proposed optical CNS will provide frequent updates to a low cost INS (inertial navigation system) which uses the 1 Hz CNS data in a Kalman estimator to provide 3 meter geo-location accuracy. During Phase I, the CNS design matured through four concepts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each one smaller, lighter and less expensive than the previous while maintaining performance. During Phase II a TRL 5 unit will be demonstrated first in the lab, then on a local mountain at 6000 feet, then on Mauna Kea at 14,000 feet.

SOCOM SBIR 10-006 provided $1.8M in funding to POC (Torrance, CA) and, as a result, enabled the development of a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) -6 weather sensor prototype, the Micro Weather Sensor (MWS), which meets or exceeds AFSOC remote sensor requirements.  As required by the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), software was also developed and implemented to ingest, compile, and disseminate MWS data.  Currently, the MWS provides a Meteorological Aviation Report (METAR) at 20, 60, or 180 minute intervals (user defined) and 360 daytime color imagery (on demand) that is fully integrated into the AFW-WEBS weather monitoring system.    Future MWS enhancements (beyond the initial STTP) include an integrated ceilometer onto the main platform, air-emplacement capability, winds aloft above the sensor measurement, chemical/toxic industrial contaminants and radiological detection/reporting, and acoustic signature detection capabilities.    BENEFIT:  The intended customers are Combatant Commanders (air & ground)/mission planners/mission tracking and post mission analysts, Air Force Weather Agency, [Navy] Fleet Numerical Meteorological Oceanographic Center (FNMOC), DoD service components, Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC), U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), and coalition partners (as required).      This effort will satisfy a combined U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) and Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT) Joint Urgent Operational Need Statement (JUONS) CC-0272, AFSOC Deficiency 0355,  Automatically Collect & Transmit Weather Observations in Deep Battle Space, DEF0205, Combine Weather Data into Battlespace Awareness Depictions for Mission Planning, Rehearsal, and Operational C2 Systems, and an AFWA requirement for a remote weather observation sensor as outlined in Observing System 21 (ORD OS-21 I/II/III).  Additionally, it will help resolve HQ AFSOC Prioritized Gap List (FY15-34) PGL5  Situational Awareness and PGL36  Planning Integration, and Joint Special Operations Command, Special Operations Meteorological and Oceanographic Collection and Integration System (SOMCIS) Capability Development Document (CDD) (JSOC, 21 Mar 07).    The Micro Weather Sensor (MWS) is new technology that fills a longstanding remote sensing surface weather data collection gap.  A primary objective of a remote sensor is to collect weather information over large spatial, denied, and inaccessible areas and integrate the data with other information to aid decision-making.  Getting more data points on the atmosphere, more frequently and from more locations is the key to improving forecasts and warnings for mission planning and execution events. Therefore, remote sensors are invaluable to increasing the accuracy and timeliness of military support forecasts and warningsthe overriding goal of this effort.  A basic necessity, therefore, is that critical aviation weather parameters are measured when and where they are needed most:  flight ingress/egress routes and data sparse regions where military aviation assets are operating.  SOWT elements currently have two (2) systems in their inventory for tactical/field use, the Advanced Distributive Sensor Systems (ADSS) Weather POD and the Vaisala TMQ-53.  Both of these systems are bulky, heavy, and relatively expensive and neither fully satisfies SOWT remote sensing requirements (size, weight, low-detection profile).  The TMQ-53 is the AF standard tactical meteorological system weighing approximately 100 lbs (when packaged for transport) and costs approximately $250K per system.  The ADSS Weather POD consists of four separate equipment items with a combined weight of nearly 40 lbs and a cost of approximately $100K per system.  Additionally, the ADSS Weather POD program has been terminated, so replacing/maintaining current systems is no longer a viable option.  The MWS in its current Phase II configuration, by comparison, consists of 2 equipment items (basic sensor and a plug/play ceilometer) with a combined weight of <3 pounds and costs approximately $27K to $54K per system (anticipated post Phase III NRE production cost at quantity 500 and 50 respectively) which provides per system cost savings of more than $200K, as compared to the TMQ-53.  The MWS is self-powered through an on-board battery pack and solar panels, providing up to 90 days of continuous operation, whereas the TMQ-53 and ADSS systems require hardwired power for operation. The MWS also eliminates the burdensome systems administration costs of the TMQ-53 by using Iridium connectivity.  Via the Iridium Constellation satellite system, the MWS can detect and report fourteen weather elements up to 3 times each hour, and also features new capabilities over existing/fielded systems, such as panoramic image capture, snow and dust accumulation detection, and single switch operation.  The STTP enhances/accelerates the MWS in several ways:  strengthens the basic MWS sensor casing, lengthening the field life and increasing reliability; fixes identified sensing/reporting issues; institutes upgrades to improve performance in all environmental conditions, including extreme cold weather conditions; provides systems for follow on testing and evaluation; develops the capability to replace batteries and extend service life, thus providing cost savings; and automates the manufacturing process to decrease production costs by up to 300%.",Gordon Drew,Chief Financial Officer,(310) 320-3088,gdrew@poc.com,Chris Ulmer,"Director, Engineering",,(310) 320-3088,culmer@poc.com,,,,1,,Joanna Jannson,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,,1,"82,402,425","126,000,000",2020,126000000,350,1985,29,29,1,1,1,Acquired by Mercury Systems in 2020: https://ir.mrcy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mercury-systems-completes-acquisition-physical-optics

Use of conventional diffraction gratings to combine wavelengths is limited in that metal is inherently absorbing. Regardless of the metal layer thickness, optical power is absorbed in the grating, altering the spectral and efficiency properties of the grating and inducing optical aberrations that reduce beam quality.Designed to overcome the peak-power damage limitations for use in petawatt (short-pulse) lasers, multi-layer dielectric (MLD) diffraction gratings are essentially transmission gratings paired with a dielectric mirror stack. Although the lack of metallic surfaces exist eliminates absorption issues, MLD gratings by definition rely on interference within the stack, resulting in higher intensities within the stack and leading to optical damage at reduced power levels. We propose to use an all-glass diffraction grating whose high efficiency is yielded by inhibiting transmitted orders, and can therefore be made of a single material with no coatings or layers.

Tactical scenarios presenta further complication because response time is critical and, as aresult, classification in the fewest number of pings is cruciallyimportant.  Historically, the decluttering issue has beenaddressed by estimating parameters of active acoustic returns andcomparing those returns against thresholds.  Unfortunately, thesethresholds are highly sensitive to the environment.  The proposed Phase II research intends to developenvironmentally robust signal processing algorithms thatsignificantly reduce clutter, improve detection, and performquickly.  To address these issues, the Phase II effort proposes tofurther develop and evaluate several techniques initiated underthe Phase I SBIR.

Most significantly, TAMDA needs to demonstrate and quantify improvement in target detection and operatorefficiency.This Phase 2 effort proposes technical objectives to address the needs of the SBIR topic.  These include: finalization of a Bottom-Loss Study to determine optimal inversion techniques; integration of Environmentally Assisted Processor (EAP) algorithms anddisplays into RDA's Low-Cost Acoustic Processor; development and integration of a communication interface to the P-3's Tactical Computer for the injection of new tactical buoy patterns; and integration of HEP data into the TAM database for further studyand analysis. A number of benefits are anticipated from the work and efforts of this Phase 2 SBIR.  First, the Navy will receive a complete L-CAP prototype signal-processing suite enhanced with EAP echo classification signal processing and operatordisplays.  The hardware suite will show marked improvement to the detection and classification process beyond that gained from the improved tactical buoy pattern from the TAMDA system.  Second, communication will be improved within the airborne tacticaland sensor systems, and between the TSC and the aircraft, by the identification and implementation of an interface to the P-3 Tactical Computer.  This interface will facilitate the injection of TAMDA-improved tactical buoy deployment patterns.

Radar detection of small maritime targets can be very challenging at high grazing angles because the radar reflectivity is masked by the much stronger reflectivity of the surrounding sea especially. Maritime wide area surface search radars have traditionally operated at low altitudes (=1000 ft ) and short coherent integration times (some non-coherently) which provide for low grazing angles where the mean clutter levels are low but where sea spikes returns may be larger than target returns. Short integration times with Scan-to-Scan integration were a necessity to maintain fast search revisit rates to provide detection of limited exposure targets. For persistently exposed targets like small boats and semi-submersibles, an alternative approach is to use longer coherent processing. Coherent processing adds the dimension of the Doppler spectrum as a radar observable. If the Doppler spectra of the small boat&#039;s return can be adequately separated from that of the sea then improved detection performance is possible. The Doppler spectra of the littoral seas varies from being rather homogeneous to being highly inhomogeneous with large discrete Doppler packets associated with free and trapped capillaries riding on surface gravity waves and swell.

CREWS is envisioned as a software add-on capability to enhance existing EW systems such as SEWIP Block II and III. System interfaces will be isolated to a single interface library, lowering the costs associated with future transition to any platform. CREWS will contain specialized modules for performing cognitive processing. Each module will accept additional algorithms via a plug-in architecture as they are developed. A primary output of CREWS will be an automatically generated, highly descriptive WML representation of newly discovered emitter waveforms. The WML descriptions are input to the EA portion of the EW system, and provide enough information to support the creation and maintenance of emitter databases.

This is not due to bad engineering.The problem is mechanical impedance matching; ocean waves offerup their power as very strong forces (10's of tons) acting atvery low velocities (< 1 m/s). To couple this power toconventional high-speed rotary electric generators, inefficientmechanisms such as spin-up gearboxes or airpressurization/turbine systems are needed. In contrast, SARA'sapproach replaces those elements with a direct-conversionmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator.  The impedance-matchingburden is shifted from the mechanical to the electrical domain,where the high currents and low voltages generated via MHD mustbe converted to practical levels.  Fortunately, this can be donewith modern electronic switches and transformers. The result isefficient, compact, economical, and deployable.  During Phase I,we designed, built, and tested a small-scale liquid-metal MHDgenerator and solid-state power converter, generating 100's ofwatts at 115V AC and solidly validating the principles ofoperation.

Advancements in machine learning (ML) allow for identification of complex patterns and adaptive anomaly detection. Since flight routing is constantly changing due to temporal variables such as weather, identifying air corridors and detecting anomalous aircraft behavior requires an online approach that takes into account such variables. Utilizing miniaturized ML accelerated hardware, a pre-trained network can be used for online anomaly detection. With such hardware it is feasible to develop a small, inexpensive, ADS-B Anomaly Detector that operates independently or in a network, on stationary and mobile platforms.

This approach is insufficient for current Navy/Marine training needs, which increasingly require different platforms and mission capabilities interacting and operating together. Stand-alone systems require instructors to gather data manually to deliver an AAR. They must resort to hand-written notes, chatlogs, and review of trainee work products to connect events and observations across systems. The current process is tedious and slow, does not scale, and results in less effective training. In Phase I, we researched and designed a novel software architecture to deliver more automated and more effective AAR. The Trafalgar architecture exploits and integrates well-structured, consistent data, but also anticipates the inclusion of unstructured documents and semi-structured data. All of this data is required to put exercise events into a coherent, causal context to support evidence-based debrief and AAR principles. Importantly, meaningful integration of heterogenous data requires artificial intelligence (AI) to integrate, process, and personalize AAR. In Phase I, we implemented several feasibility demonstrations using AI to capture meaningful learner and performance data, even from stand-alone systems, and used this captured data in a proof-of-concept AAR Delivery environment that tailors its presentation based on evidence-based principles and the individual performance of individuals and teams.

The goal of the Sonalysts and WhaleAcoustics research is to determine how to protect marine mammals, particularly beaked whales, while allowing the Navy to conduct sonar training.  The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) makes it harder to study the problem.  We propose to analyze passively recorded data gathered by High-Frequency Acoustic Recording Packages (HARPs) placed at 300 m and 1000 m depth at the Southern California Offshore Range (SCORE).  These types of continuous broadband recordings have been shown to include the pings of active sonars and communicative calls produced by identifiable species of cetaceans.  Correlating the occurrence of these sounds with possible changes in the animalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s acoustic communication calls and travel directions will provide insights on methods for beaked whale detection, abundance in SCORE, as well as how to safely clear an exercise area of cetaceans.  The result of these analyses could impact future Environmental Impact Statements filed by the Navy with the National Marine Fisheries Service for sonar test ranges and could be brought into court in the continuing legal challenges to the use of Navy sonar under the MMPA.",Jean Miceli,Contracting Officer,(860) 326-3787,jmiceli@sonalysts.com,Margaret Bailey,Principal Investigator,,(860) 326-3621,bailey_m@sonalysts.com,,,,0,,Dave Hinkle,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,,,"56,431,363",,,56431363,400,1973,35,35,1,1,0,"Dave Hinkle has a JD, not a Ph.D."

When the EA-18G enters service it will be equipped with ALQ-99 jammer pods that were initially designed for the EA-6 in the late 1960's. NAVAIR recognizes the limitations inherent in continuing to upgrade the ALQ-99, and, has identified a need for a Next Generation Jammer Pod with capabilities matched to the EA-18G. The NGJ Pod will be powered by an on-board turbine / generator to make the pod independent from aircraft power sources. The pod will require a minimum of 60 KVA of power generated at an airspeed of 220 knots and an altitude of 25,000 feet, with the turbine/generator located within the body of the pod. The key metrics for pod power generation are weight and volume efficiency. In Phase I SA has demonstrated the feasibility of power generation for this application with an internal, tangential in-flow Tesla (bladeless) turbine. A Tesla turbine packages well, has a relatively high power to weight ratio and requires only a short length of ducting to route air into the turbine.

Sepulveda Blvd,Suite 800,Los Angeles,CA,90025,,"ABSTRACT:  The IED is a difficult and effective threat due to its evolving nature and loosely defined composition.  Due to the variations in design and configuration, no single sensor, or single sensor platform, can reliably detect IED devices with practical false alarm performance in tactical environments.  However, many existing sensors, including some operational in Iraq and Afghanistan, have demonstrated capabilities to address various pieces of the IED puzzle.  These sensors generally detect a subset of the IED anatomy and have marginal false alarm rates in operational environments.  By fusing the data from current sensor technologies, a multi-source fusion system will improve efficacy rates by detecting more IEDs at a safe stand-off distance prior to detonation.    In Phase II, TSC will develop an end-to-end prototype COMIDT system to enhance situational awareness and countermeasures against IEDs.  The prototype system will be developed from TSC&#039;s Phase I design and demonstrate the following capabilities:    1. Combine real and simulated sensor reports from three or more heterogeneous sources reporting on critical components of the IED anatomy.    2. Transfer the sensor reports over a distributed network to a centralized fusion server.    3. Receive sensor reports through a common data fusion interface.    4. Apply data fusion algorithms to the sensor reports and display the fused system result to an operator interface.    BENEFIT:  The TSC proposed Cognitive Multi-sensor IED Detection Technology (COMIDT) and its critical components have benefits and commercial applications on multiple levels to the DoD, FAA, domestic law enforcement, and other US Government agencies.  DoD applications are readily apparent for supporting military operations and saving lives in current tactical environments, by diminishing the threat of IEDs to civilians and the warfighter. FAA and domestic law enforcement applications would provide safety and reliability in the inspection and evaluation of people, luggage, homes, and suspicious containers for evidence of HME fabrication.    A successful, efficient, and reliable sensor fusion system providing an integrated situational awareness display would support systems across all branches of the DoD.  Systems such as Guardian Angel (BAE), Cooperative Engagement Capability (Raytheon/US Navy), Distributed Common Ground System, Sand Dragon (Aero Mech/AFRL), Blue Devil (SAIC/AFRL), Radiant Falcon (SAIC/AFRL), JLENS (Army), NC3S Vigilare (Boeing), Husky Mounted Detection System (Niitek), Vehicle Optics Sensor System (US Army), and Healy Beacon (JIEDDO) could benefit from this technology.",Mike Pope,Operations Manager,(256) 535-2109,mike.pope@tsc.com,Dan Lawrence,Senior Staff,,(256) 535-2142,dan.lawrence@tsc.com,Stub,,,0,,Peter Swerling,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,,1,"182,785,152",,,182785152,385,1966,47,47,1,1,0,"Acquired by Westinghouse Electric Corp. in 1985; acquired by Allied Technology, Inc. in 1978"

Sepulveda Blvd,Suite 300,Los Angeles,CA,90025,,"Mobility Air Force assets deployed in forward positions are vulnerable to enemy air defenses and require protection, typically provided by high-power standoff/support jammer aircraft loitering outside the range of enemy missiles while radiating high-power jamming waveforms at large region of enemy territory.  However, the position of the jammer may be such that the jamming power is directed at the sidelobes of some threat emitters, and hence ineffective. In order optimize the jam coverage of the standoff jammer, real-time information is needed of threat emitter locations, so that the jamming assets can be repositioned. To address this issue, TSC demonstrated in Phase I of this study the feasibility of a concept denoted TEGS, which geolocates ground-based emitters with sufficient accuracy to allow the jammer to correct its spatial coverage.  For Phase II of this topic, TSC proposes to fully define the TEGS system design;  predict/estimate its performance characteristics via high-fidelity digital modeling and simulation tools;  develop, procure, assemble, integrate, and test hardware and software of a TEGS Proof-of-Concept Demonstration System;  perform and document tests to measure the efficacy of the TEGS concept in Geolocating ground-based emitters of opportunity;  and identify commercialization paths for the concept, both for military and civilian applications.  BENEFIT:  It is anticipated that the potential outcome of this study will be hardware and software designs that will result in a small, lightweight ES receiver that can be carried onboard UASs, possessing the capability of detecting a variety of RF emitters, utilizing either conventional or low-probability of intercept (LPI) waveforms.  The software algorithms, in combination of small UAS fleets (at least four), will provide the ability to Geolocate these emitters with sufficient accuracy to optimally position support jammers to protect vulnerable MAF assets.  The technology may also benefit domestic commercial applications, among them are rescue missions to locate hikers and skiers carrying small RF beacons, and homeland security missions such as locating teams of intruders that communicate using cell phones.

The toolkit provides a plug-in modular framework to facilitate the creation of planning mission scenarios and will be able to support environmental condition display, asset availability and condition tracking, route planning, multiple vehicle cooperation, marine mammal operation support, undersea communications system planning, or mission de-conflicting between heterogeneous vehicles.  Using a shared database for information, mission plans, and vehicle parameters, multiple plug-ins can access the same data.  The time slider component of the GUI allows the user to adjust time into the past or the future.  This allows one to view historical mission data and preview future mission plans.  The capabilities created during the Phase I project have greatly improved the process of planning an AUV mission.  By seeing the effect of the forecasted environmental data on the mission plan, a user can visually see the predicted AUV track.  This has greatly reduced the time, effort, error, and improved the reliability of common AUV planning.  The results of this project will have applications not only in the Department of Defense mission planning, but in the research and commercial world as well.   BENEFITS: The Modular Mission Planning Toolkit will have broad applications across all users of Autonomous Undersea Vehicles (AUVs).  As AUVs become prevalent, it will be imperative that missions be planned with the best environmental data available.  Additional concerns are the coordination of multiple AUVs, and the retrieval of environmental data from deployed AUVs back into environmental models.  Finally, the AUV user community is growing to include NOAA, NSF, and NASA.  The flexible nature of the MMPT design addresses all these concerns.  This project will provide our nation significantly improved mission planning capabilities for unmanned systems.

These capabilities and broadly vary operational conditions lead to a complex design and human factors scenario for the forward seating positions that cannot be solved using a passive seat suspension.  Injurious shock loads transmitted to the occupants when traversing over water in high sea states as well as harmful shock and vibration transmitted to the occupants when the vehicle is traveling over land pose a threat to occupant health and significantly limit mission length.  To address this, a retrofit-capable Semi-Active Magnetorheological Vehicle Seat (SAMVS) system was developed in Phase I which adapts to these broadly varying operational conditions as well as occupant weight to provide optimal protection of the occupant during EFV missions.  The key technologies behind the SAMVS system is a retrofit-capable magnetorheological (MR) damper that can be electronically controlled by compact control electronics featuring a control algorithm developed specifically for this application.  With these technologies, the SAMVS system enables a unique single solution for all shock and vibration environments encountered by the EFV.  It has been shown that the SAMVS system can reduce the shock dosages applied to the occupant by 33% in water mode and reduce the vibration transmitted to the occupant by 65% as compared to the current passive suspension system.

Both hardware and software limitations have dictated the level of inspection throughput, accuracy and reliability. In Phase I, TWI developed and demonstrated feasibility of a novel technique to thermographically inspect large composite areas at a large standoff without expected trade-off in performance. Using a sophisticated signal processing scheme and projected, modulated optical excitation, we demonstrated detection of subsurface features in composite materials at a working distance of 45 feet from the target. The results were comparable to (and in some cases better than) results from commercial flash thermography systems operating at close range. In Phase II, we shall build on the Phase I program and develop a commercially viable solution (prototype) - LASLAT (Large Standoff / Large Area Thermogrpahy) offering flexibility so it can be readily adapted to a broad range of applications requiring rapid large area NDI with a focus on wings of C-130J family of aircraft operated by our military.",Rebecca Simpson,Administrator,(248) 414-3730,bsimpson@thermalwave.com,Steven Shepard,President,,(248) 414-3730,sshepard@thermalwave.com,Stub,,,1,,Steven Shepard,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,,,"5,000,000",,,5000000,14,1993,18,18,,1,1,

Energy storage is becoming a key enabler for power systems operating with high levels of transient power requirements and supporting fuel-efficiency operations while maintaining capability.  High density energy storage which operates continuously at high charge and discharge rates to support these loads under the combination of finite space, high power and energy requirements, stringent safety characteristics and wide upper temperature ranges drive the requirement for advanced cooling systems.  Proper thermal management of these high power electronic systems becomes more difficult as increasing power density requirements push heat generating components closer together.  This is made more severe due to relatively low full power operating temperature limits (in the range of 55-60C for certain components) which force designers to de-rate the components to ensure reliable operation. The combination of close proximity, volumetric self-heating, and platform coolant temperatures as high as 50C all contribute to increased system volume from redundant storage arrays operating with reduced energy density. While ongoing research efforts are attempting to develop components with higher operating temperature limits, improved methods of efficiently managing the thermal aspects of batteries, capacitors and flywheel motor/generators provides a near-term reduction in the need for component de-rating which would reduce component redundancy and increase system power density.  Storage devices with a cylindrical, can-style structure cannot efficiently couple to the high performance cold plates and heat sinks being implemented to cool other components. Although air-cooling methods (including finned adapters, etc.) have been utilized in the past, system volume constraints and platform placement typically remove useful convective flow paths. Other proposed techniques for thermal coupling have included the use of inefficient thermal interface materials, thermal conduction through the electrical terminals, or significant modifications, none of which provide a cost and performance effective solution.     Innovative R&D is needed to investigate cooling architectures which can be enabled for cylindrical geometry energy storage components that must be integrated into larger arrays.  The technologies should be scalable from small 18mm type cells through motors of 100mm or greater diameter.  The cooling architectures should be able to space-efficiently couple to a backplane, being integrated into shelving or cabinet designs to help maintain climate or thermal isolation and regulation throughout the device.      The innovative products brought forth through this SBIR effort should not contain precious or hazardous materials, nor require significant interfaces in order to support.  It is optimal for these devices to operate such that chilled water is not required, though fresh and/or seawater can be assumed to be available at 40C, with sufficient flow available to meet mission needs.  Ambient spaces should be assumed to be up to 60C and worst-case device maximum temperatures should also be assumed to be 60C.  In order to maintain density of the energy storage devices, these cooling structures should not expand the individual components greater than 10%, yet be capable of supporting pressure both from the inside in the form of cooling fluid flow, as well as external under compression of a battery pack, expansion during cycling operation, etc. If a special cooling fluid is to be utilized, the interface to facility/platform cooling fluid should be considered, along with the impact on efficiency and device/system density and packing factor.",Joe Boswell,,(415) 264-0668,joe.boswell@thermavant.com,Joe Boswell,,,(415) 264-0668,joe.boswell@thermavant.com,,,,0,,Bill Ma,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,,,"8,060,232",,,8060232,58,2007,8,8,1,1,1,Received funding from the Missouri Technology Corporation in 2023

The multi-aperture unit views three areas of the sky separated by 120 degrees in azimuth using a single focal plane array, detects and identifies stars, and calculates three celestial lines-of-positions (LOPs) and a celestial fix. The sensor operates autonomously and delivers a latitude/longitude fix every 6 seconds with position error of less than 100 m. The sensor software includes a background subtraction and a SNR enhancement algorithm, star catalog, star pattern recognition software, software for mapping of the instrument axis, algorithm for computation of the LOPs and celestial fix, and low-level instrument-control code.  The field test will demonstrate that the hardware prototype of the ACNS meets all the performance goals.",Michael Andranovich,Director of Contracts,(858) 646-5533,mandranovich@trexenterprises.com,Mikhail Belenkii,Sr. Supervisor Scientist,,(858) 646-5479,mbelenkii@trexenterprises.com,,,,0,,Mikhail Belenkii,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,,,"18,473,736",,,18473736,200,2001,3,3,1,1,0,

To meet mission requirements in a cost effective manner, USVs must deploy a variety of towed subsystems. Each system is designed with unique handling gear for deployment and retrieval. With limited space aboard LCS and high life cycle cost, it is desirable to move towards a small set of common subsystems used by USVs and UUVs to meet critical missions. USVs face a significant challenge in meeting the speed-depth profile for high resolution towed sensors. A lightweight sensor handling system with power to the deployed sensor and bi-directional high data rate communications is contrary to conventional surface platform design principles which use heavy tow cables, heavy depressors, or dynamic-lift depressors to achieve depth. The technology solution that is proposed here is a Propelled Tow Body (PTB) (powered through the tow cable) which achieves depth using forward thrust instead of weight or downward lift. The USV-PTB system will be designed to optimize the speed-depth towing profile while minimizing the motions transmitted from the USV to the sensor. This will be achieved using a unique control system developed by VCT.",Douglas Humphreys,President,(703) 620-0703,dhumphreys@vctinc.com,Douglas Humphreys,President,,(703) 620-0703,dhumphreys@vctinc.com,,,,1,,Doug Humphreys,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,,,"80,000,000",,,80000000,20,1993,16,16,,1,0,

Copper brush electroplating is the standard repair technique for many Navy corrosion repair applications, however this process is plagued by long buildup times and use of hazardous substances. Cold spray offers a viable opportunity to replace copper brush electroplating for many repair applications. During the process, the metal particles never reach melting temperatures, but are fused through kinetic energy transfer and adiabatic shearing processes, therefore substrate heating is minimized and dimensional stability is maintained. Cold spray deposited metals exhibit exceptional mechanical properties, where grain size and structure can generally be maintained from the powdered state to the as deposited condition.

An important potential advance is creating a vehicle able to rest on the bottom.  Most AUVs must remain in motion, or possibly equilibrium in neutral buoyancy mode at controlled depth with little or no propulsion.  The ability to be both mobile and rest on the bottom creates many opportunities.  In particular, advantages include: much longer missions; operating during certain hours with quiescent periods; avoidance of bioluminescent trail; remaining quiescent until triggered by events; accurate observation of local tides and currents; etc.  A mobile to stationary conversion will allow a traditional bottom mounted sensor platform to be deployed from over the horizon, covertly move into position, and then become a bottom fixture.

An array of vector sensors could be placed at choke points toidentify potentially hostile crafts.  Lastly, the vector sensor could be used to aid in Oil and Gas exploration.  The sensors directional qualities could be used to more precisely pinpoint the location of potential drilling sites.",Jim Michaelis,COO,(301) 216-3016,jmichael@wilcoxon.com,J.

Traditionally, crews of maintainers and technical experts have been sufficient to analyze faults throughobservation and electrical troubleshooting.  However, this approach is unsuitable for modern avionics, in which thousands of electrical connections may exist between hundreds of avionic subsystems.  As a result, significant effort has been expended todevelop automatic reasoning systems capable of sensing state parameters and making accurate decisions concerning the condition of the system.     To reduce the complexity and cost associated with avionic system maintenance, Williams-Pyro proposes to continue development of its novel prognostics/diagnostics tool based on artificial neural network (ANN) technology.  WPI has proven theeffectiveness of this concept within the Phase I effort and intends to further improve the Smart Embedded Avionic Monitoring System (SEAMS) to ensure operational suitability.  Developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Arlington, the SEAMSalgorithm combines the diagnostic capabilities of three different neural networks to produce a health monitoring analysis more accurate than any taken separately. The SEAMS system will provide an embedded means of detecting faults within avionic circuitry.  If successful, this system will drastically reduce the cost associated with avionic maintenance - reducing the number of man-hours needed as well as the amountof test equipment.  The initial target market for our Smart Embedded Avionic Monitoring System (SEAMS) is the U.S. Marine Corp's AH-1 Super Cobra Helicopter, the attack version of the UH-1",Brent Williams,Vice President,(817) 872-1500,brent.williams@williams-pyro.com,Matthew Scarpino,Electrical Engineer,,(817) 872-1500,matt.scarpino@williams-pyro.com,,,,1,,Steve Obey,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,,,"20,644,917",,,20644917,74,1963,40,40,1,1,0,Tibbetts Award winner

Problems are frequently discovered in the hardware/software prototyping or flight test program phases, when they are difficult and expensive to fix and likely to result in significant program perturbations.  Potential safety issues that were not forecast can also be encountered.  Recent studies by both U.S. and NATO organizations have identified structured modeling technologies and processes (including the evolving Model Driven ArchitectureÃ‚Â®, or MDAÃ‚Â®, process supported by commercial industry) as having a high potential to significantly mitigate the identified problems, if appropriately adapted and incorporated into the platform avionics and weapon integration design approach.  To support such a model-based process, flexible modeling algorithms for weapon control systems and associated weapon employment functionality need to be developed in languages such as the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) and Unified Modeling Language (UML).  The effort proposed here would demonstrate development of modeling algorithms for an example weapon control application in accordance with requirements developed under the Phase I study effort.",Claude Connell,President/CEO,(850) 664-6203,claude_connell@wintec-inc.com,Fred Benedick,"VP, Systems and Technolog",,(850) 664-6203,fred_benedick@wintec-inc.com,,,,1,,Mike Gibbs,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,,,"4,515,804",,,4515804,25,1983,25,25,1,1,0,
